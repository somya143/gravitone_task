It is a Role based authentication app.
In backend I have used proper and clean MVC+dao structure and jwt for authetication based on access token and refresh token. 
In client side if a user registers as admin and then logins then the user will be directed to student page and if admin then will be directed to student page and if managemant the will be directed to corresponding page.
All the 3 routes student,admin and management are protected routes.
